# The project

We can find lots of cheap GPS trackers, aimed to be used with a server provided by some obscur chinese company.
The original server is generally based on the open-source solution OpenGTS. I'm shure this solution is great,
but, as a developer (and for fun), I wanted a more simple solution with services I could tune easilly.

So, here is my simple server made in Javascript on top of NodeJS :)

# Installation

git clone 
npm install
cp config.json.sample config.json
node index.js
